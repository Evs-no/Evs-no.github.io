This project is made to bring attention to the siblings of pediatric cancer patients to light. Typically the sibling can feel neglected or have a hard time adjusting to life after being affecte. i wanted to make this to inform parents and also the siblings that they are not alone and if they want to talk with someone there are people willing to listen.
