    <h2>Relations With the Family</h2>
    <p>
      When a family has a child diagnosed with cancer, it not only affects the child and the parents but it also affects the siblings in the family. The brother or sister will have their entire world flipped. They may feel neglected and resentful but at the same time hide those feelings because they don't want the rest of the family to be worried. It is extremely important to connect with the siblings just as much as the parents or the patient.
