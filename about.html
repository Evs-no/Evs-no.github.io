      <p>
        Hello! My name is Eva. I created this project during the Summer Immersion Program at Girls Who Code. I wanted to create this website as it is a topic that is very close to me. When I was young my brother was diagnosed with a brain tumor. At the time I felt that there wasn't anyone I could really feel comfortable talking. This website was created to be informational for parents but more importantly it would provide access to a community for the siblings to comfortably express themselves.
